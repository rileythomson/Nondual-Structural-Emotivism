## üìñ Overview

Nondual Structural Emotivism (NSE) is an applied philosophical framework developed to clarify how morality emerges naturally through stable emotional-intuitive patterns embedded within unified, nondual consciousness. NSE moves beyond traditional moral dualities (subjective/objective, self/other) towards a more integrated, pluralistic, and compassionate ethical understanding.

## üåü Key Features

- **Nondual Ontology:** Morality arises intrinsically within unified consciousness, not externally imposed.
- **Emotional-Intuitive Wellspring:** Stable emotional patterns ground morality rather than rationalistic rules or imposed duties.
- **Integrative Reason:** Reason harmonises emotional-intuitive insights, refining ethical coherence.
- **Moral Attractor States:** Provides stable, emotionally grounded ethical points (compassion, coherence, fairness) guiding prosocial moral growth.
- **Pluralistic and Inclusive:** Recognises legitimate moral diversity, fostering peaceful coexistence and mutual respect.
