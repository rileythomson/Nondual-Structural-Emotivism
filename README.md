## 📖 Overview

Nondual Structural Emotivism (NSE) is an applied philosophical framework developed to clarify how morality emerges naturally through stable emotional-intuitive patterns embedded within unified, nondual consciousness. NSE moves beyond traditional moral dualities (subjective/objective, self/other) towards a more integrated, pluralistic, and compassionate ethical understanding.
